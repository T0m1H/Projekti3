How was the workload divided I made this project by myself.

Technologies I used in this project HTML, CSS and jQuery. HTML and CSS was familiar to me before from developing websites course. In this course we are studying Javascript and in this project we were using jQuery, so it is new thing to me to learn. The applications outfit is very simple, so i was able to focus more in jQuery.

Setup
